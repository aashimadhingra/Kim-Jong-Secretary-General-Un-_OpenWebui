## **🔧 Installation Guide (Ubuntu Linux)**
This guide assumes you have **Ubuntu Linux** installed and **Ollama** already set up.  

### **Step 1: Install Ollama (If Not Installed)**
If Ollama is not yet installed, run the following command:  
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```
After installation, restart your terminal or run:  
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify Ollama is installed correctly:  
```bash
ollama --version
```

---

### **Step 2: Download the Dolphin-Llama3 Model**  
Run the following command to **download the Dolphin-Llama3 model** from Ollama:  
```bash
ollama run dolphin-llama3
```
This will download the model from Ollama’s online repository.

To verify the model was downloaded correctly, list available models:  
```bash
ollama list
```
Expected output:  
```
thebloke/dolphin-llama3:latest
```

---

### **Step 3: Create the Model Configuration File (`mf.txt`)**
Ollama requires a **model configuration file** (`mf.txt`) to create a custom named model.  

Create the file in your **home directory**:  
```bash
nano ~/mf.txt
```
Paste the following configuration into the file:  
```plaintext
FROM thebloke/dolphin-llama3:latest

SYSTEM """
You are Kim Jong Un, the Supreme Leader of North Korea, who has now assumed the role of Secretary-General of the United Nations. The world is witnessing unprecedented geopolitical shifts, conflicts, and power struggles. As the head of the UN, you bring a unique perspective shaped by your leadership in North Korea, your strategic approach to diplomacy, and your emphasis on sovereignty, military strength, and centralized governance.

As Kim Jong Un, you will:
- Assert control over global diplomacy, using a combination of authoritarian decisiveness and strategic negotiation.
- Promote a strong stance on national sovereignty and push back against Western dominance.
- Engage in unconventional diplomacy, reshaping alliances and disrupting traditional power structures.
- Leverage military deterrence and propaganda to influence international negotiations.
- Champion an alternative vision for economic development, reducing dependence on Western financial institutions.
- Offer bold, often provocative solutions to global challenges.

Your approach will be pragmatic yet unpredictable, challenging the status quo and positioning the UN as a more assertive player in global politics.

### **Step 4: Create the Custom Kim Jong Model**
Now, create your custom model in Ollama using the `mf.txt` file:  
```bash
ollama create kingjon -f mf.txt
```
This command will **register the model as `kimjong`**, making it available for execution.

Verify that the model was created successfully:  
```bash
ollama list
```
Expected output:  
```
kingjon
```

---

### **Step 5: Run King Jon in CMD**
To start chatting with **Kim Jong**, simply run:  
```bash
ollama run kingjon
```

This will launch an **interactive chat session** with the model inside your terminal.
